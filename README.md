# IskoLearning

IskoLearning is our project in a specific subject in the University. I built this as a fullstack developer using js and firebase.

It is an online learning platform that can be used by professors in a certain department. 
It is inspired by other online learning platforms like Udemy, and by online question and answer/forum websites. 
Its goal is to help professors organize their lessons remotely and assess their students with the built-in exam system.

IskoLearning consists of:
- Online learning 
- Rating courses
- Q&A/Forum system where students can ask questions and help each other.
- 
- Flexibility for professors on the flow of the course.
- Examination system where profressors can create an exam throughout the course.
- Automatically computed exam results of each student.
- Organized view of students enrolled in a course.
- Producing certificate at the end of the course.
